title: Zombie Transactions (Post migrated from Ghost blog)
---

Came across an interesting one today...

Having moved to a clean environment for UAT which started this week, users were suddenly presented with a "serious error" when they tried to view a list of their tasks to process, presented to them in a web based screen. This hadn't happened before.

Immediately after examining the error detail, it was throwing a strange stack trace:

at System.Data.SqlClient.SqlTransaction.ZombieCheck()

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/zombie.jpg "eeeeeh")

Oh dear.

After some digging around, I found that "zombie transactions" are those that cannot be committed (e.g. an unrecoverable error) but are still open.

Essentially when the frame loads, it sends a whole batch of SQL transactions to the db to determine user permissions, status of transactions, who they belong to etc - and several of these transactions could return errors, without a problem as the frame will only ever load what is applicable to the user.

However not, in this case as it was throwing the serious error no matter the user.

Because if any of these statements in the batch failed, they would be closing the connection while inside the context of a transaction - hence the zombie status.

And then I remembered...

In my last post, I'd done a lot with MDTC transactions to get a different web app working cross-server. In that scenario, I needed the connection to close if anything failed and there were no nested transactions to create zombies from.

In order to do that, I'd set XACT_ABORT on for those two databases.

Hoping this was the answer I checked the database properies... and sure enough XACT_ABORT was set 'on' as default! Not idea. So I switched it off, and sure enough - problem solved.

I'm definitely learning!"

_including how much i hate UAT, it's so stressful._
