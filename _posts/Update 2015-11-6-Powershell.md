title: Powershell // Baby steps (Post migrated from Ghost blog)

So I ventured in to Powershell for the first time.

I know it's super powerful, and is something I'd really like to explore more. But as I'm bollocks deep in SQL for this project, it's not right now.

However, for now:

``` code
      qwinsta # Check who's connected
      rwinsta [session id] # Kill the connection
```
    
Used this to kill idle connections from Belfast (the other software team) one evening so I could refresh the server.
