### [0] New Zealand Pilsner | Verdant Brewing Co | 4.9%
Crisp, refreshing and suitably hopped with Nelson Sauvin for a satisfying bitterness and bright, citrusy notes on the finish. A crushable Southern Hemisphere pilsner (and a birthday boy favourite!)

### [1] Biscoff Porter | Electric Bear Bewing Co | 8.2%
This porter was created with biscoff biscuits in mind. A complex malt bill consisting of 11 different malts, aims to create a biscuity, creamy doughlike backbone complemented with sweetness provided from light muscovado and Belgian candi sugar.

This is all combined with large quantities of Ceylon cinnamon, crystallised ginger, and a dash of nutmeg. Post fermentation, the addition of vanilla pods helps to found this beer into a thick and creamy caramel delight.
