### [0] New Zealand Pilsner | Verdant Brewing Co | 4.9%
Crisp, refreshing and suitably hopped with Nelson Sauvin for a satisfying bitterness and bright, citrusy notes on the finish. A crushable Southern Hemisphere pilsner (and a birthday boy favourite!)

### [1] Biscoff Porter | Electric Bear Bewing Co | 8.2%
This porter was created with biscoff biscuits in mind. A complex malt bill consisting of 11 different malts, aims to create a biscuity, creamy doughlike backbone complemented with sweetness provided from light muscovado and Belgian candi sugar.

This is all combined with large quantities of Ceylon cinnamon, crystallised ginger, and a dash of nutmeg. Post fermentation, the addition of vanilla pods helps to found this beer into a thick and creamy caramel delight.

### [2] Big Fruit Heist | Double-Barrelled Brewery | 6%
Looks like rubicon mango, nose shows lots of fruit, peach sits at the front. Front is puckeringly sharp peach fruit juice. Sour level is spot on here, mellows as you go through but very refreshing. A great intro for anyone who is not a fan of sours.

### [3] Parka | Double-Barrelled Brewery | 4.5%
12g/L of Citra dry hopping gives you Citraâ€™s vibrant citrus notes followed with an ever so slightly bitter finish, leaving you wanting more.
Parka is perfect for well balanced, sessionable drinking.
