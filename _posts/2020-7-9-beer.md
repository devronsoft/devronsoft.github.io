### [0] New Zealand Pilsner | Verdant Brewing Co | 4.9%
Crisp, refreshing and suitably hopped with Nelson Sauvin for a satisfying bitterness and bright, citrusy notes on the finish. A crushable Southern Hemisphere pilsner (and a birthday boy favourite!)

Chosen as the starter to fully appreciate the beauty of the Sauvin hops without interference.

### [1] Biscoff Porter | Electric Bear Bewing Co | 8.2%
This porter was created with biscoff biscuits in mind. A complex malt bill consisting of 11 different malts, aims to create a biscuity, creamy doughlike backbone complemented with sweetness provided from light muscovado and Belgian candi sugar.

This is all combined with large quantities of Ceylon cinnamon, crystallised ginger, and a dash of nutmeg. Post fermentation, the addition of vanilla pods helps to found this beer into a thick and creamy caramel delight.

Chosen to follow the soft Sauvin starter as a heavy hitting dark.

### [2] Big Fruit Heist | Double-Barrelled Brewery | 6.0%
Looks like rubicon mango, nose shows lots of fruit, peach sits at the front. Front is puckeringly sharp peach fruit juice. Sour level is spot on here, mellows as you go through but very refreshing. A great intro for anyone who is not a fan of sours.

Chosen as a palate cleanser following the thick creamy porter, also tart and refreshing.

### [3] Parka | Double-Barrelled Brewery | 4.5%
12g/L of Citra dry hopping gives you Citra’s vibrant citrus notes followed with an ever so slightly bitter finish, leaving you wanting more.
Parka is perfect for well balanced, sessionable drinking.

A light and non-intimidating pale ale, positioned before ramping up with something dark thick and malty next.

### [4] Sadako | Weird Beard Brewery | 9.5%
Brewed with 10 different malts, including oats, with additions of honey, molasses and fresh coffee beans.  This is a deliciously rich, complex and intense dark beer that has been held back in the brewery for 6 months to ensure it's ready for release.

### [5] Eskimo Joe | Fierce Brewing | 5.0%
Eskimo Joe is a smooth pale ale infused with cold pressed coffee and hint of vanilla.  Using cold press techniques ensure a full coffee experience without the
bitterness of espresso.

This one is actually a pale ale and has no bitterness - chosen in position to bring tastebuds back around after the previous special release.

### [6] People Like Buns | Fierce Brewing | 6.5%
Well, people DO like buns don’t they? Especially Danish cinnamon buns... This beer was made with loads of dried fruit, cinnamon bark and spices to recreate the Danish classic in beer form.

At this point we should be back in a neutral position, ready for something sweet and flavoursome (and a bit different).

### [7] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS I HAVEN'T DONE YET | Double-Barrelled Brewery | 5.4%
Introducing You're Talking About Things I Haven't Done yet, a hazy, juicy pale ale with complex hop notes. It brings light, citrus notes from the Citra dry hop, alongside pungent tropical fruit and pine from Idaho 7 and all the good stuff that Mosaic brings to the party. This one is for the Sarah Connor fans in the room.

I'm expecting this to be very hazy and piney, with the mix of hops described.

### [8] Pineapple Express IPA | Tiny Rebel | 6.2%
Hazy and pale. Strong pineapple juice nose. Juicy taste and nice hop to it with a lovely finish.

### [9] Pass the lime my friend | 71 Brewing | 5.2%
Michelada is a Mexican beverage made with lager and lime juice, served in a chilled, salt-rimmed glass. We created an authentic Mexican style lager, hopped it with wai-iti and noble hops with additions of lime zest and the merest hint of salt to create a super refreshing, zingy, ‘cerveza preparada’. Salud!

### [10] Mariana Trench | Weird Beard Brewery | 5.3%
Great people, weird beards, fantastic hand-crafted beer: that pretty much summarises London’s Weird Beard Brew Co. The no-gimmick Mariana Trench is their delicious American Pale Ale that is packed full of the best American and New Zealand hops. Huge aromas of mango, passionfruit and grapefruit hit you in the nose right away yet the flavour finds enough balance with a moderate bitterness that it’s easy to drink a lot more than you intended to! A lighter body and a crisp, clean finish means this American Pale Ale is perfectly refreshing.

### [11] Cold Brew Coffee Sour | Electric Bear Bewing Co | 4.0%
This somewhat daring combination of coffee and sour beer has been a persistent request from Alex. He insisted that “it’ll be bloody brilliant trust me!” so we thought with the world being a completely different place to how it was a few months ago, now would be the perfect time to give this idea a go.
A simple malt bill used in our gose recipes, balanced with coffee selected from our not too distant neighbours Roundhill Roastery, we’ve aimed to balance the delicate sourness from the beer with dark chocolate and berry notes from the coffee to give a beer that aims to test all elements of your tastebuds.
