title: First windows forms app (Post migrated from Ghost blog)
---

I've got quite a bit to catch up on, as 3 weeks have passed since my last post and so has GO LIVE DATE - software went into production on Monday 4th April as planned, so lots to write up in that area.

But this post is about something completely different - c#!

I now consider myself a SQL pro, and next on the list of getting to grips with is C#, particularly windows applications (both console and with GUIs).

And so - very basic - but a milestone nevertheless, as it is the beginning!

My first creation to start getting into the layout (using Visual Studio as the IDE) and syntax, is a simply logon box which checks credentials and then either moves along to another window or denies access:

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logon2.PNG "basic...")

Two text boxes, and two buttons with code behind them.

Note the password is hidden - which is this line:

```C#
textBox2.PasswordChar = '*';
```

Failed logon:

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logon3.PNG "basic...")

On 'submit' the application executes a database connection and query (on username and password combination). If the returned result set is not 1 row, access is denied:

```C#  
  private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

        SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(@"Data Source=DESKTOP-R62H60S\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=ryanprojects;Integrated Security=True");
        SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter("select count(*) from tbl_users where username='" + textBox1.Text + "' and password= '" + textBox2.Text + "'",con);
        DataTable DT = new DataTable();
        sda.Fill(DT);

        if (DT.Rows[0][0].ToString() == "1")
        {
            Hide();
            main ss = new main();
            ss.Show();
        }
        else MessageBox.Show("Nope - try again...");
}
```

_NOTE: YES I KNOW THE SQLDATAADAPTER SHOULD BE A STORED PROC AND NOT A QUERY but this was just something quick and dirty to test the principles, the database I created was just the one table:_

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logon5.PNG "omg")

I'm pretty pleased with it, and it's given me even more motivation to carry on and really dive into C# like I did with SQL, plus the fact that of course they tie in well together!
