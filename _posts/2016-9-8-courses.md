As I mentioned, I'm keen to get a formal qualification in compsci.

I've now got a couple of options to evaluate... it's going to be pretty intense either way, on top of a new job as a junior dev - lots to learn, but I love it.

Both are online (but still "real" university qualifications). As much as I'd love the full immersion experience, I'm not sure I can afford the setback both financially and career wise - when I've already got a job... In no order:

### Option 1:
#### Postgraduate Certificate in Software Engineering

University of Liverpool 
(1 year)

Computer structures => This module covers everything from computer architecture to databases, algorithms, languages, operating systems, communications, computer networks, artificial intelligence and the theoretical foundations of computation. By studying this module, students will gain a sound theoretical and practical grounding on which to build their understanding of future technical developments.

Object oriented programming (Java) => This module develops the essential problem solving, and consequent programming skills, required to generate well- structured object-oriented programs in Java. The module also explores important techniques (such as distributed systems and component technology) that have made object-oriented programming todayâ€™s predominant software development paradigm.

Software engineering => This module encompasses the theoretical foundation and practice of the three key phases of problem definition, software development and maintenance. It covers identification, definition, design, analysis, verification and management of basic requirements, coding, testing, evaluation and quality assurance.

Professional issues in computing => This module helps IT professionals to be capable in their chosen professional areas, operate effectively in work and community situations and to be aware of their environments.

#### What I like about it:

- Covers algorithms and the foundations of compsci

- Java

- Only takes 1 year

#### What I'm not sure about:

- Kinda expensive

- Will look random to have a UK qualification?

- It's only a certificate

### Option 2:
#### Graduate Diploma in Information Sciences (Computer Science)

Massy University 
(1.5 - 2 years)

Computational Thinking => An in-depth study of data structures and the design and analysis of algorithms to solve real-world problems. The course has a practical focus based on the correct implementation of algorithms in a high level programming language. An introduction to computability, tractability and strategies to address issues related to intractability.

Application Software Development => A study of the rudiments of structured and object-oriented software development methods and techniques. Students will utilise a modern integrated development environment to gain practical skills.

Database Design => An introduction to databases and the underlying relational and selected non-relational approaches. Students will gain practical skills designing, creating and querying databases using Database Management Systems and discuss fundamental concepts - such as vertical and horizontal scaling, transactional safety and eventual consistency - and their implications in the selection of database approaches.

Software engineering design & construction => A study of techniques, methods and tools used to design and construct high-quality software systems.

Computer systems => Computer architecture, assembler, processor organization. A case study, highlighting the decisions involved in producing a well-designed computer architecture.

Intelligent machines => This paper introduces fundamental techniques to create intelligent machines, including formalisms for representing knowledge and reasoning about it, methods for searching and planning, and approaches to machine learning.

Advanced web development => A study of the programming and scripting languages, frameworks and tools used to develop web and distributed applications with a consideration of security and privacy issues involved in these technologies.

Concurrent systems => This course builds on concurrency theory giving practical experience in all aspects of concurrent programming, including issues of synchronisation. Operating systems, structures and techniques are presented as examples of complex, concurrent programs.

Strategic management for IS => A comprehensive study of issues, concepts and methods used in the strategic management of information systems and information technology.

IOT & Cloud computing => This paper provides an opportunity for a practical, scenario-based and integrated study of The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing concepts, models, infrastructures and capabilities. Students will learn, practice and innovate on the unified IoT and Cloud Computing paradigm through a running scenario and working application that integrates the IoT with Cloud Computing services.

#### What I like about it:

- Covers algorithms and the foundations of compsci

- Well known NZ university

- Wide range of topics, proper grad degree

#### What I'm not sure about:

- Takes longer

- Have to start later (Feb next year rather than end of this month)

- Not sure it covers enough actual programming detail

Hmmmmm lots to think about, no wonder I'm not sleeping too well at the moment.
