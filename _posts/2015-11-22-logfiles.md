title: Problem solving and log file trawling (Post migrated from Ghost blog)
---

Over the last week, a lot of unit testing has been going on so I have become pretty good at reading server process logs, finding what is going wrong, and fixing it...

One example I was pretty happy with happened on Friday afternoon.

Basically, the big complication of this current project is that we are trying to integrate two systems - one of which (the master system) is really not designed to have any interference from other systems. So we're having to create workarounds in many different situations.

One of these, is to do with delivery of goods. End users will use the minor system (a ASP .NET web application) to record the event that stuff they have ordered has been delivered.

To migrate this event across to the master system, the minor system writes to a table setup specifically for importing this data. I then have a trigger on this table, so once it is written to this kicks off a series of server process in the master system to validate the entry, and then write the event to four different tables (it has a complicated schema!).

Now, after much trial and error we finally got this working end to end. And then it stopped working for seemingly no reason.

I found this error: 

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/algdelivery.JPG "whothewhatnow")

So after interpreting line after line of the validation server process execution code, it turned out that part of the validation was to make sure the delivery has a unique event number.

If the user was recording that their stuff was delivered in the master system, it would simply assign a unique number to this event.

However, because the integration is effectively sidestepping this process by just porting the information in from elsewhere, it misses the chance to receive this number - and - the field does not exist on the import table. So, the only information written for the 'delivery' event is the order number. Which is why it worked the first time - but then as soon as you get more stuff delivered on the same order, it fails.

So - how can we get around this when we cannot assign a unique delivery number (because the import table does not allow it?)

By intercepting the server process with this:

     UPDATE xxxdelivery_Tbl
     SET unique_no = (SELECT "new" = max(unique_no) + 1
                              from xxxdelivery_Tbl
                              WHERE STUFF = STUFF )

     WHERE last_update = (SELECT max(last_update) 
                              from xxxdelivery_Tbl
                              WHERE STUFF = STUFF)

     GO
   
Yeah some cool nested stuff triggered to happen 60 seconds before the unique check so it can never fail (for this reason).

Learning: 
There is logic to everything, even if it seems to be working for no good reason!
