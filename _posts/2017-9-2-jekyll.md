title: Migration to Jekyll/Github pages
---

Clearly I let my postings slip for a long time - for various reasons. For a start, I stopped paying my Ghost subscription so the blog went offline.

Today, I have restarted by migrating my blog to Jekyll, and hosting on Github pages. I have migrated all historic posts (just by copying the text from Ghost, and creating .md files using the original dates).

Initially, this is just a forked Jekyll instance - however I am working on my own theme install and will switch over when ready.

I'm in a Windows environment, so I used RubyInstaller to install Jekyll and Bundler, and am using these to play around with for now.

I also have a static site currently [hosted here on AWS](http://www.devronsoft.com/).

I'm not 100% sure yet what this will be used for, perhaps something professional or maybe just to explore what AWS has to offer.
