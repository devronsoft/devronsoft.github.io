title: The importance of the SDLC (Post migrated from Ghost blog)
---

Over the past 10-12 months, the majority of the development I have done has been essentially under duress; that is - either something is not working as intended and needs to be patched ASAP to keep the project moving, or - someone (ok a user) has suddenly changed their mind/misunderstood/remembered something they forgot - whatever - but has identified a critical departure from the original solution design, and of course it needs to be done by... yesterday.

Well.

Technically, for me, it's been great. I've absolutely pushed myself time and time again to design and implement solutions at the drop of a hat. This project was of course heavily SQL development based - but I needed to push that out too into SSRS, Javascript and now C#.

However.

An important lesson I have learnt from "off design" development is that NOBODY WILL THANK YOU AND IT WILL NEVER BE GOOD ENOUGH. You can stick you neck out and work weekends to deliver what someone asked for, only for them to find fault/be unimpressed/require more. It took me a long time to realise it but actually - all the admin of defining the solution, signing it off, having the users test (UAT) etc is not a load of crap - it's to protect us developers from the ever changing minds of the end users.

Now, in my current situation - I regret nothing, because as intense as it has been the learning has been invaluable. Just a lesson to hold on to for the future I think.
