title: MDTC config over distributed systems (Post migrated from Ghost blog)
---

So -

I've built an app - specifically an ASP.NET web application, which consists of a relatively simple user interface on top of an extremely complicated backend.

It exists to allow user intervention in the processing of a certain type of business transaction between two systems. And I'm pretty excited about this, because I build it all myself from scratch - and it's going into production along with the "main event" software that this project has all been about!

I want to write more about this in the next post - but right now I want to outline an issue it has taken me all day to overcome, that I'm pretty damn pleased with.

#### The problem

- Web app built on server intending to publish via IIS
- Tested OK on server, deployed over IIS as embedded URL within another existing application (an ERP)
- Remote access tests failed

#### The intention

- The ultimate output of the application is a complex, cross server stored procedure that includes a CURSOR statement to iterate through a parameterised result set, manipulate the information and update two systems
- Note that the architecture of these two systems is different - one running Windows Server 2003 and SQL Server 2000 (yes really) and the other Windows Server 2012 R2 and SQL Server 2012.
- They both need to write to each other.

#### Problem solving process

The first error was a relatively simple one:

```SQL
The current action cannot be completed. The user data source credentials do not meet the requirements to run this report or shared dataset. Either the user data source credentials are not stored in the report server database, or the user data source is configured not to require credentials but the unattended execution account is not specified.
Alright Mr. Kerberos. So what's happened here is that the application is accessing it's datasets via Windows Authentication. And Kerberos is not having it, as impersonation is not allowed so it's passing it a domain user of 'NULL' and therefore access denied.
```

Rookie mistake - went back and created a SQL logon with the relevant permissions, and applied to both servers and the linked server connection.

Should work now. NOPE:

```SQL
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]The operation could not be performed because the OLE DB provider 'SQLOLEDB' was unable to begin a distributed transaction.
```

What the hell! What even is a distributed transaction?

Well it's all to do with the configuration of MDTC - or, Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator; a Windows component that is responsible for coordinating transactions that span multiple resource managers, such as databases, message queues, and file systems.

Aha! So because I was getting too clever, and executing stored procs all over the place (well across two servers but OK) this is now considered a "distributed transaction" and configuration must be applied accordingly, to allow this to happen remotely across the two servers.

So, to Component Services!

#### Server 2012

I've allowed both inbound and outbound distributed transactions (so this is the application sitting on one server, and sending insert/update statements to another).

Note that I've only gone with 'No authentication' as these servers are both within the same firewall and are secure. Mutual authentication would be the safest option generally.

#### Server 2003

OK both servers good to go. Let's try again...

```SQL
Unable to start a nested transaction for OLE DB provider "xxxx" for linked server "xxxx". A nested transaction was required because the XACT_ABORT option was set to OFF.
```

Whaaaaat are you having a laugh?

This one wasn't too bad. It's a compatibility thing - both sides of the distributed transaction want to know it will be rolled back if something goes wrong half way. Fair enough. It's not enough though to include this at the beginning of the stored procs - MDTC wants to know this is in play as default, but this is an easy fix through SSMS (applied to both servers):

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/xactabort.JPG "woohoo")

And that solved it!

2 happy servers means 1 happy application, and a very proud guy off to get a pizza!
