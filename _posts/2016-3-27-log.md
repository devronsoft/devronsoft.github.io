title: Transaction log filling fast! (Post migrated from Ghost blog)
---

A lot has been going on over the last few weeks, clearing UAT and moving at top speed towards a release date in 8 days time, I've been very busy -

and one of the things (I was putting off) I'm now focused on is the migration of data from the legacy system to the new ERP.

Oh yeah it will be easy I thought - BUT, it has presented several challenges, both from a scripting but also server/dba perspective, which I've found interesting.

Essentially, the legacy system has around 10 years worth of transactional data - only to be migrated based on certain conditions. And, those conditions exist across two systems. Easy? No - because they are two poorly designed databases which is a killer headache from an ETL scripting point of view.

I had to spend days chasing links around both databases, to try and scrape together some data integrity - really the main problems were:

System A and System B do not share a common index at the same level of detail (i.e. no idea of a GUID to link with)

The majority of PK's used by System A are integers, and although they do randomly appear in System B they are just jammed into long text fields YES WHAT THE HELL I know.

System A exists only to create data around a masterfile that System B doesn't consider to exist; hence the jamming of text fields with important IDs just to get them in there - but they are not recognised, indexed or searchable by System B (HOW THE HELL DID PEOPLE USE THIS APPLICATION FOR SO LONG WITHOUT GOING MENTAL I'll never know).

Anyway hundreds of LOC and a dozen scripts later, and I've put together what I consider to be a high quality migration sequence, considering the challenges of these systems.

There is also an element of mapping involved, so it is important to trial the sequence as many times as possible to flush out any mapping errors (of which of course there will be many).

The servers I'm working with are pretty high spec - each with 2TB disks for the main sql data files, and a 500GB additional disk for general stuff - the OS etc.

So imagine my surprise when I remoted on after a day of testing to see this BRIGHT LIGHT:

Whaaaaaaaaaat! The database hasn't even gone into production yet. And I have a maintenance plan in place which performs a full backup each night. Shouldn't this keep the data files... I don't know, normal?

Yes - but - because of the repeated high volume of transactions (essentially performing the entire data migration multiple times in one day, between backups) the transaction log had ballooned and filled up the entire server.

OK so I was in a bit of a panic, but when I realised this I began to read about how the transaction log really works. The database is in 'FULL' recovery mode - so the transaction log wants to keep everything until it gets backed up.

So what you have to do is backup the db, switch to 'SIMPLE' recovery mode and then tell the log that you don't want it anymore by truncating it. (Then switch back).

This is because the transaction log is automatically truncated when the database is using the simple recovery model (seems to be new from 2008 onwards).

However, the log won't truncate if there are active (uncommitted) transactions. I had to find and kill some of these via

```SQL
  DDBC OPENTRAN
  ```
  
Which displays information about the oldest active transaction and the oldest distributed and non-distributed replicated transactions, if any, within the transaction log of the specified database.

I'll be adding this to the checklist for the data migration weekend - it is a huge pain because the server starts running as slow as an amiga 64 when it has no space left. Hopefully truncating the log between each trial run should do the trick - given that it only got this bad after an entire day!

But I've found this stuff interesting - when writing code, you don't really think about what the database is doing - it's just there and it just works. But actually there's a whole lot to learn behind it - still a lot to learn, but loving it all! :-)
