title: String or Binary Data would be Truncated (Post migrated from Ghost blog)
---

Another long break between posts... 
I've been very busy trying to survive UAT. I had 95 issues from round 1 and as the only developer on this team I've been working 7 day weeks to clear (getting there).

So, a brief post but it's something:

I recently came across what appears to be a commonly complained about SQL error message, aborting a transaction and simply returning the message "String or binary data would be truncated."

It seems the SQL community have been on at Microsoft for years to improve this error message to actually say which column/field is being violated, and by which action.

Essentially, the transaction you're trying to commit gets aborted because committing it is impossible - it could be due to a trigger, or field restrictions on a table being inserted into. But you have to sleuth it out yourself.
